# hello-world

Have you ever seen terrible code where spaces and tabs are mixed and indentation is seemingly random? Instead of interpreting it as people being incompetent or not caring, I choose to believe that there are Whitespace programs hidden in there. Like in this Hello World in both Java and Whitespace. Not sure if that is actually better though.
